# PublicApinception

Sometimes you want to start a project involving an API, but you don't want to mess around with getting a key. This is where Public APInception saves the day! Using the Public APIs API, you can search for exactly what kind of public API you need!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'public_apinception'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install public_apinception

## Usage

Running this file will start the CLI

    $ bin/public_apinception

 You start with a list of categories of APIs to choose from. Once you choose a category you will be shown the APIs in that category. Once you have chosen an API to view, the info will be displayed along with some options including Go back to categories, Open API link, and Exit. 

 Have a great project!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
